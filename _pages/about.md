I study the stochastic dynamics of continuous-time generative diffusion models, with a focus on non-Markovian fractional Brownian motion, which introduces long-range memory and anomalous diffusion absent in standard Brownian models. In addition, I work on applying diffusion models in medicine and the natural sciences.

Previously, I received my master's and bachelor's degree in mathematics from Technical University of Berlin with focus on stochastic processes and machine learning.
